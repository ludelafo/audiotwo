# Contributing to panosse

Hey! Thank you so much for your interest in panosse. It means a lot to me!

If you need any help, feel free to contact me. Please be aware that panosse is
maintained by a single person (for now) driven by passion. I'm doing my best to
maintain this project as best I can.

Please follow the next guidelines if you want to contribute to panosse.

## How to contribute

Before you start contributing to panosse, please agree to the following
guidelines:

- [ ] [Code of conduct](https://github.com/ludelafo/panosse/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Check that an issue or a pull request is not already opened for your contribution

Start by checking if an issue or a pull request is not already opened for your
contribution:

- Issues: <https://github.com/ludelafo/panosse/issues>
- Pull requests: <https://github.com/ludelafo/panosse/pulls>

### Open an issue

If no issue nor pull request has already been opened regarding your
contribution, open a new issue at
<https://github.com/ludelafo/panosse/issues/new/choose>. Please use the right
template to open the issue and fill its content.

A maintainer will have a look at it and get back to you as soon as possible to
let you know if your contribution is accepted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Always [open an issue](#open-an-issue) before creating a pull request. This
> allow to discuss and review that everything is aligned between the
> maintainer(s) and you.

### Create a branch from the issue and checkout

Once all parties have agreed on the new contribution you want to add, create a
branch to start your contribution from the right sidebar of the newly created
issue.

Locally, checkout to the new branch and commit and push as soon as possible and
as frequently as you want.

### Create the pull request

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Always [open an issue](#open-an-issue) before creating a pull request. This
> allow to discuss and review that everything is aligned between the
> maintainer(s) and you.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> GitHub uses the last commit message as the pull request title. **Please use
> the issue title you created earlier instead.**

After your first push, create a pull request from the GitHub interface at
<https://github.com/ludelafo/panosse/pulls> **with the issue title you created
earlier**.

> [!TIP]
>
> If your pull request is still a work-in-progress, you can mark it as
> [**Draft**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request).
>
> You can then change it to **Ready** once you are ready for a review.

### Add a reviewer

Add a maintainer as a reviewer so they can have a look at your contribution when
they can.

### Wait for a review

As soon as a maintainer can, they will give you a feedback on your contribution.

### Make changes if needed

Most contributions should be quite straight-forward. However, the reviewer might
ask you to do some changes. Please let them know if the potential multiple
reviews take too long and demotivate you.

### Merging of the contribution

Once the pull request is good to be merged, the reviewer will merge your
contribution with the main branch.

Thank you VERY MUCH for your contribution!

### When will the contribution(s) will be released?

Please check the section [Next release of panosse](#next-release-of-panosse) for
more details.

## Next release of panosse

I try to release new versions of panosse as soon as possible. However, no exact
date or time is set. Hopefully, as soon as a new feature is merged, a new
version of panosse will be released using the Semantic Versioning Specification
(SemVer). More details at <https://semver.org/>.
